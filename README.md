### **Project Description**
This Project demonstrates the creation of a synthetic dataset, followed by the application of linear regression to analyze the data. The project serves as an educational example for understanding how to generate data, model linear relationships, and evaluate results using Python.

### **Key Features**
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Manually created dataset simulating a linear relationship between independent and dependent variables with added Gaussian noise.
- **Linear Regression Application**: Model training, coefficient estimation, and result evaluation using statistical metrics.
- **Visualization**: Scatter plots and regression lines to illustrate the relationship and model accuracy.
- **Code Implementation**: Simple and clear Python scripts to help users understand the workflow.

### **Technologies Used**
- **Python**: Primary language for data generation and regression modeling.
- **Libraries**:
  - `numpy` for numerical computations.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.
  - `scikit-learn` for regression modeling and evaluation.

### **Applications**:
- Educational purposes for understanding data modeling and regression analysis.
- A foundational project for beginners in data science and machine learning.
- A baseline example to extend into advanced modeling techniques.
